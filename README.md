bank app

I created an online banking system with features such as Check Balance, Deposit Money, Withdraw Money,Account Register and Exit. First, the user is required to log in to the system using their username and password. Unregistered users can click the register button to be taken to the registration page, where they can sign up to access the system. User credentials are securely stored in a database.

Options:
